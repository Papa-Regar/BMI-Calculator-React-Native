# BMI-Calculator-React-Native

Hello world

This is my first React Native Project. Currently im learning more on frontend project.

In this apps, I learned
- Basic View,Text,Stylesheet, SafeAreaView, Textinput
- Combine CSS with React Js
-Learn the basic of useState

Difficulties
-Text going out of screen. I solved it by using SafeAreaView.
-ToucableOpacity not working. Turns out that I forgot to import ToucableOpacity from 'react-native'.
-Once I enter value value of weight/height, keyboard does not dismiss. Thus, I learned about TouchableWithoutFeedback, and keyboard.dismiss function.

Creator comments

Well, basically this apps function well. Content is straight forward and easy to use.
However, apps design is quite boring. I need to learn and improve more on my CSS skills.
